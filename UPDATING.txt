2015-03-30:
    In order to add support for MS SQL as a target platform,
    the [pglogon] section in the configuration file has been
    renamed to [sqlserver].

    This section now takes an extra, required keyword: servertype
    The value of 'servertype' must be "postgres" or "mssql".

    Old Version Example:
    [pglogon]
    # postgresql db connection parameters (write-access)
    host= localhost
    port= 5432
    dbname= mydb
    user= myuser
    password= mypassword

    New Version Example:
    [sqlserver]
    # target sql server connection parameters
    servertype= postgres

    # postgresql db connection parameters (write-access)
    host= localhost
    port= 5432
    dbname= mydb
    user= myuser
    password= mypassword

    For servertype= mssql, the port is optional if we are
    connecting to the local SQL server cluster not via TCP/IP.
    We also use 'hostname\instance'

    [sqlserver]
    servertype= mssql
    host= (local)\SQLEXPRESS
    port=
    ...
